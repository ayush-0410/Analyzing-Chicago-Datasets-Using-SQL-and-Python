# Analyzing Chicago Datasets Using SQL and Python

## 📖 Overview
This project was developed as part of the **IBM Data Science: Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python** course.  
It focuses on applying SQL and Python to analyze real-world datasets related to **Chicago’s Census, Public Schools, and Crime records**.  
The analysis was conducted using **SQLite** as the database engine and **Python** for executing SQL queries and performing data analysis.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Gained hands-on experience with **SQL fundamentals** such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation.
- Applied **intermediate SQL techniques**, including **JOINs**, **subqueries**, and **set operations**, to explore complex relationships.
- Utilized **Python libraries** like `sqlite3` and `pandas` to connect databases, execute queries, and analyze retrieved data.
- Derived **data-driven insights** about Chicago’s community demographics, school performance, and crime distribution.
- Enhanced understanding of **data management, relational databases**, and **analytical workflows**.

## 📂 Datasets Used
The following open datasets were analyzed:
1. **Chicago Census Data** – Contains demographic and economic information by community area.  
2. **Chicago Public Schools Data** – Includes school performance, ratings, and locations.  
3. **Chicago Crime Data** – Records reported crimes, case numbers, and community area mapping.

## 🧩 Key Tasks Performed
- Imported datasets into SQLite.
- Queried data to extract insights on population, income, school performance, and crime rates.
- Joined multiple datasets to identify patterns between education, economy, and crime.
- Visualized data summaries and findings through Python and SQL queries.

---

## 📊 Example Analyses
- Identified community areas with the highest **poverty rates**.
- Retrieved the community area with the **highest hardship index**.
- Compared **crime rates** and **school performance** across different neighborhoods.
- Calculated the **average per capita income** by community area.
